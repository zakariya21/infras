- Student name: NAME
- Repository URL: <https://github.com/HoGentTIN/USERNAME/REPO>

This repository contains the lab assignments for the course Infrastructure Automation, which is part of the [Bachelor Applied Computer Science programme](https://www.hogent.be/opleidingen/bachelors/toegepaste-informatica/) at [HOGENT](https://www.hogent.be/).

The goal of these assignments is to get familiar with concepts like Infrastructure as Code, container virtualization, CI/CD, monitoring, etc.

This repository contains some scaffolding code, based on [ansible-skeleton](https://github.com/bertvv/ansible-skeleton), a framework for quickly setting up an Ansible development and testing environment powered by [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com).

- [vmlab](vmlab/): a lab environment that, when you're finished, will consist of several VMs set up using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/).
- [dockerlab](dockerlab/): sets up a VM to experiment with container virtualization.
